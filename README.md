# Customer Segmentation using PCA and KMeans

This project uses unsupervised learning techiques to identify meaningful customer segments using the Wholesale Customers Dataset from UCI.

## Project Overview

- Perform data preprocessing
- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality
- Use KMeans clustering to segment customers
- Evaluate and visualize clusters
- Intepret clusters and derive insights

## Dataset 

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Name:** Wholesale Customer Dataset

## Techniques Used

- Data cleaning & scaling
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- KMeans clustering
- Silhouette score & analysis
- Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Requirements

Install the required libraries using: pip install -r requirements.txt

## File Structure

- 'YourNotebookName.ipynb': Jupyter notebook with the full analysis
- 'requirements.txt': Python libraries used
- 'README.md': Project documentation (this file)

## Key Insights

- PCA reduced the dataset to key components explaining most varience.
- KMeans identified distinct customer groups with unique spending patterns.
- The PCA visualization showed clear cluster seperations.
- This segmentation can guide marketing and product decision.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/mahleka29/unsupervised-learning-pca-kmeans.git
2. Navigate to the folder and open the notebook: cd unsupervised-learning-pca-kmeans jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
